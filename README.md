<h1>Infrastructure Development Schemes Analysis</h1>
<h3>Project Overview: -</h3>
<p>
  In this project, I utilized Power BI in combination with SQL to conduct a comparative and comprehensive analysis of various road development schemes initiated by the Indian government.
The data for this analysis was initially stored in an SQL database, which I imported into Power BI using a DirectQuery connection. Additionally, I integrated supplementary data from web sources, including state-wise and sector-wise GDP growth statistics.
Extensive data cleaning and transformation operations were carried out to prepare the dataset for meaningful visualization. By leveraging various Power BI visuals and creating custom measures, I designed an interactive dashboard that offers both a comprehensive overview and a comparative analysis of the progress and other key aspects of these infrastructure development schemes.
The dashboard evaluates the performance of these schemes at both the state and district levels, examining factors such as completed development works so far, allocated budgets, expenditures, and more. Furthermore, the report explores the impact of infrastructure development on the GDP growth of states and various sectors.
